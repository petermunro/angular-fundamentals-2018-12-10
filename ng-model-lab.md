# ngModel Exercise

## Re-creating our Input Component

1. Earlier, you created a component with an `<input>` field which rendered its border red or green depending on whether there was input.

   Create a new version of this component, this time using `ngModel`.

## Using ngModel for Other Input Types

Create a component that has these inputs:

- an input field
- a checkbox
- a select field
- a "Save" button

Use `ngModel` for each one, and when "Save" is clicked, display the captured values.
